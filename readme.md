It features an intuitive interface for adding, deleting, and rearranging dialogue entries, with support for color-coded speakers and exporting/importing dialogues in JSON format.

## Prerequisites
Please install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for you operating system.  Please ensure Git is available for execution by running:

## Usage
